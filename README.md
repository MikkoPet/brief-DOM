### About The Project

Three modules to learn the base functionalities of Javascript DOM Manipulation :
- A carousel, toggling between four images on click input
- A shopping list, with the ability to add AND remove items
- A score keeper, which counts points between two players and blocks input once the set maximum amount of points is reached on either side.
